for babel commands

for conversion to jsx in a particular file
babel srcfile --out-file=targetfile --presets=env,react

this will watch all the changes in the source file when we save it
babel srcfile --out-file=targetfile --presets=env,react --watch

please run live-server for the public folder then every time we change the file
the changes are reflected in the target file and it loaded in the browser also

every time I open the application first follow the above steps before coding
